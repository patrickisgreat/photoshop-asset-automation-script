Hello.

This script can be easily installed by adding it to your /Adobe app/Presets/Scripts directory. 
Once it's installed it can be run from the File -> Scripts menu in Photoshop.
Feel free to edit it to accomodate your needs. 
The code is well commented so you can understand what is going on.

Enjoy!
Patrick
